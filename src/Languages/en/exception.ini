; Exception Class Description
DESCRIPTION_LogicException = "Exception that represents error in the program logic. This kind of exception should lead directly to a fix in your code."
DESCRIPTION_BadFunctionCallException = "Exception thrown if a callback refers to an undefined function or if some arguments are missing."
DESCRIPTION_BadMethodCallException = "Exception thrown if a callback refers to an undefined method or if some arguments are missing."
DESCRIPTION_DomainException = "Exception thrown if a value does not adhere to a defined valid data domain."
DESCRIPTION_InvalidArgumentException = "Exception thrown if an argument is not of the expected type."
DESCRIPTION_LengthException = "Exception thrown if a length is invalid."
DESCRIPTION_OutOfRangeException = "Exception thrown when an illegal index was requested. This represents errors that should be detected at compile time."
DESCRIPTION_RuntimeException = "Exception thrown if an error which can only be found on runtime occurs."
DESCRIPTION_OutOfBoundsException = "Exception thrown if a value is not a valid key. This represents errors that cannot be detected at compile time."
DESCRIPTION_OverflowException = "Exception thrown when adding an element to a full container."
DESCRIPTION_RangeException = "Exception thrown to indicate range errors during program execution. Normally this means there was an arithmetic error other than under/overflow. This is the runtime version of DomainException."
DESCRIPTION_UnderflowException = "Exception thrown when performing an invalid operation on an empty container, such as removing an element."
